# SP17-PlugIn
This responsitory is made by Christian king, Josh Warren, and Deja Hintzen to track all source code for the note taking chrome plug in. All code is for the KSU senior project class.

How to use:

1st. You need to install firebase npm! Firt, install node.js onto your computer. Make a new npm prject using "npm init -y" in the command prompt after installing, then "npm install firebase"

2nd. You need the 4 firebase files in your project because Notelee imports firebase functions from those files.

3rd. In firebase-main.js, you must add your own firebaseConfig. You can get the firebaseConfig when you start your own firebase project.
